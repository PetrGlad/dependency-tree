_dependency-tree_ is simple plugin that shows recursive dependencies of given Java project in Eclipse.
Dependencies are written to a text file.

This plugin can be helpful to resolve circular dependencies of a project. 
Standard means of Eclipse are too tedious for this task and for large workspaces manual tracking of dependencies can be daunting.
