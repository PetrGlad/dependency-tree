Intro
-----

_dependency-tree_ is simple plugin that shows recursive dependencies of given Java project in Eclipse.
List of (directly or indirectly) required projects is written to a text file.

This plugin can be helpful to resolve circular dependencies of a project. You may want to use it because 
standard means of Eclipse are too tedious for this task and for large workspaces manual finding all  
project dependencies can be daunting. 

Usage
-----

In Java's package explorer open Java project's context menu and choose "Show dependencies/Show dependencies", 
refresh the project, look into file dependencies*.txt.
